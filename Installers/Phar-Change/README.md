#Tutorial:

To install ImagicalMine or Genisys, you must have previously installed PocketMine-MP. 

To start, we must go to the directory(folder) for our server. If it is in the root directory: ```cd Server``` (Assuming you didn't rename the folder)

Then, we must download the script to update our server.
For ImagicalMine: ```wget ```
For Genisys: ```wget ```

Now, we will give the permission to our script:
IM: ```chmod +x ImagicalMine-Installer.sh```
Gen: ```chomp +x Genisys-Installer.sh```

Now we can run our script!
IM: ```./ImagicalMine-Installer.sh```
Gen: ```./Genisys-Installer.sh```

The rest should be self-explanatory. After the script is finished, reload your server. You're done!
