#Tutorial:

__**Note: All commands must be entered in SSH Console.**__

##**For PocketMine..**

**1.** First, Download the PocketMine Installer by entering this command at SSH Console,

wget later.com

**2.** After the installer has been installed, we need to create a screen to where we create our server, (Don't know [Screens?](https://www.rackaid.com/blog/linux-screen-tutorial-and-how-to/))..
To create a screen do screen -S (screen name)

After that you will be instantly teleported to the newly created screen..

**3.** After that.. We need to give permissions on our installer, but, we need to go to the directory where we installed the installer (Optional, Normally it's in the root directory).. Now we give permissions :3

chmod +x PocketMine-Installer.sh

After that, we need to run the Installer to start setting up the server! :D

./PocketMine-Installer.sh

Then, the dependencies, tools and the Setup wizard will now run! Good Luck! :D
